# Drum-Beats
This project was my initial project to implement the Javascript skills that I acquired. It is a fun project and comparatively an easy one to start with. Regardless, I got to learn a lot through it.

## Features
- The beats can be played by clicking on the buttons.
- The beats can also be played if you press the corresponding keys on your keypad.
